## Contributions

There‚Äôs several ways to contribute, not just by writing code.


### Improve documentation

As a user of this project you‚Äôre perfect for helping us improve our docs.
Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, new examples, etcetera.
Anything!

### Improve issues

Some issues lack information, aren‚Äôt reproducible, or are just incorrect.
Help make them easier to resolve.

### Give feedback on issues

We‚Äôre always looking for more opinions on discussions in the issue tracker.

### Write code

Code contributions are very welcome.
It‚Äôs often good to first create an issue to report a bug or suggest a new feature before creating a pull request to prevent you from doing unnecessary work.

### Review Pull Request

Review pull request can be hard work, so every previous contributor can review PRS. If you are not a previous contributor but you want to do this, write me `gtrabanco@fwok.org`.

## Support

See [`support.md`][support] on how to get help.

## Submitting an issue

*   The issue tracker is for issues, help, discussions and feature request. When you open an issue you will see comments to help you in the report.
*   Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new issue
*   Ensure you‚Äôre using the latest version of projects
*   Use a clear and descriptive title
*   Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue error message, version, operating system, etcetera.
*   The more time you put into an issue, the more we will

## Submitting a pull request

*   See first the [Roadmap](https://github.com/gtrabanco/sloth/wiki/Roadmap)
*   Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent you from doing unnecessary work
*   For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the community for feedback as soon as possible
*   New features should be accompanied with tests and documentation
*   Don‚Äôt include unrelated changes
*   Lint and test before submitting code by running `$ npm test`
*   Write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request:
    it‚Äôs your job to convince us
*   Two small PRs are prefered than one big PR
*   Separate issues from features in a PR, if you need to fix an issue to develop a feature or you find an issue when developing a feature. Make a `fix` branch, solve the issue, make the PR in the repository. Apply the patch by cherry-pick or by merging in the `feature` branch. Show in the description that PR ## is included in this feature.
*   Merge master is preferred in PR if there is any update. We prefer that you solve the possible merge conflicts.
