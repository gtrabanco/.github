# Security policy

## Scope

If you believe you’ve found a security issue in any software, service, or
website governed by remark, we encourage you to notify us.

Projects governed by remark sometimes do unsafe things by design (such as a
plugin that executes arbitrary code or an option that is dangerous).
This unsafe behavior should be explicitly documented and, if it is, is not
considered a security issue.

There are no hard and fast rules to determine if a bug is worth reporting as a
security issue or a “regular” issue.
When in doubt, please do send us a report.

## How to submit a report

Severe security issues can be reported by using issues or sending an email to
`gtrabanco@fwok.org`, with all details you know.
Give us 72 hours to review and reply something before publish.

Any other security issues use issues in the project to report it.


## Safe harbor

**remark** supports safe harbor for security researchers who:

*   Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data,
    and interruption or degradation of our services
*   Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the
    account holder.
    If you do encounter Personally Identifiable Information (PII) contact us
    immediately, do not proceed with access, and immediately purge any local
    information
*   Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve vulnerabilities prior
    to any disclosure to the public or a third-party
*   We will consider activities conducted consistent with this policy to
    constitute “authorised” conduct and will not pursue civil action or initiate
    a complaint to law enforcement.
    We will help to the extent we can if legal action is initiated by a third
    party against you

Please submit a report to us before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent
with or unaddressed by this policy.

## Preferences

*   Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps and a clearly
    defined impact
*   Submit one vulnerability per report
*   Social engineering (such as phishing, vishing, smishing) is prohibited
